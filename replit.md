## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with functional components and hooks.
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming.
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives, based on shadcn/ui design system.
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack React Query for server state.
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for build-time type checking.

### Client-Side Processing Philosophy
All data processing occurs client-side using native Web APIs (File API, Canvas API, Web Audio API, PDF-lib, etc.). This ensures user privacy by preventing data transmission to servers while delivering professional-grade tool functionality.

- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic meta tag generation, including 25+ AEO-specific properties (answerSnippet, questionKeywords, entityMentions, voiceSearchQueries).
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized asset loading.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**: Dedicated components (AnswerSnippet, EnhancedFAQ, VoiceSearchOptimizer, FeaturedSnippetOptimizer) targeting featured snippets, voice search, and position 0 results with semantic keywords, topic clustering, and AI crawler support (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot).
- **Favicon System**: Comprehensive, multi-size favicon support for various devices and platforms (PNG, ICO, Apple Touch Icons, Safari Pinned Tab, Microsoft Tiles, PWA Manifest integration).

### Ad Integration System
