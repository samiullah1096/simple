## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack React Query for server state
